Note that in this model there is no acceptance boolean. Their role is played by the existence
in the current choices of an {\sl External} transition.

The acceptance condition for the full language is that, when the input string has been 
completely read, we are in a terminal phase, and the final {\sl External} transition has
a {\sl v} component which is recognized as {\sl final} - here we shall adopt the convention
that {\sl v} must be empty. Otherwise, when the input string is not empty, it must
contain {\sl v} as a prefix. 

The next module will present the corresponding reactive engine,
which will be used to realize possibly non-deterministic transductions.
