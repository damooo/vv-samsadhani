\subsection{Building a trie lexicon from a byte stream}

The function {\sl trie\_of\_strings} reads on its standard input a stream of
strings separated by newline characters, builds the corresponding
trie lexicon, and writes its representation on its standard output.

It depends on a module {\sl Encoding}, which defines the string
encoding used through conversion functions {\sl encode} and
{\sl decode}.
