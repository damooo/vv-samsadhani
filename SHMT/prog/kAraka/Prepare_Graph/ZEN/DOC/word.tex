\subsection{Words}

We assume that the alphabet of string representations is
some initial segment of positive integers. Thus a string is coded as
a list of integers which will from now on be called a 
\ocwbegincode{}$\ocwupperid{word}$\ocwendcode{}. %[word]

For instance, for our Sanskrit application, the Sanskrit alphabet 
comprises 50 letters, representing 50 phonemes. Finite state transducers 
convert back and forth lists of such integers into strings of 
transliterations in the roman alphabet, which encode themselves either
letters with diacritics, or Unicode representations of the 
{\sl devan\=agar{\=\i}} alphabet. Thus 1,2,3,4 etc encode respectively
the phonemes /a/, /\=a/, /i/, /{\=\i}/ etc. 

In these notes, we shall assume rather a roman alphabet, and thus 1,2,3,4 etc 
encode respectively letters a, b, c, d etc.
