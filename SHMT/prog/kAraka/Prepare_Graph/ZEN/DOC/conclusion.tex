What we just constructed is a simple engine which may recognize a Sanskrit sentence 
as a sequence of inflected word forms. Actually such forms are glued together 
using a euphony junction
process known as {\sl sandhi}. It is possible to invert the sandhi relation while doing
the recognition, and to use the transducer output to give a trace of the sandhi relation
between the words. Piping this process through a lemmatizer, which itselfs inverts the
flexional morphology, yields a Sanskrit tagger. This application is described in
\cite{2004-Huet-1}.
