## History
#Date 24/3/09
#This program is added to prune the output of morphological analyser.
#The morphological analyser has a dictionary with head words extracted from the Monier William's dictionary. Though it has a good coverage, many a times it shows outputs that are very rare.
#In order to get a better coverage, we decided to go for a more practical dictionary: Apte's.
#Initially we restricted the answers even to match the gender so that unnecessary answers are out.
#But later we realised that the viSeRaNas can be in any of the 3 genders, and hence especially for viSeRaNas it is not a good practice to restrict to a particular gender.
#So we have reverted back to all the possible analysis, with roots restricted to Apte's dictionary.
#This restrictions we apply only to the samaasa and subantas, and not to waxXiwas and kqxanwas.

# In case none of the root-gen pairs matches the o/p, all the o/p is reproduced without prunig.
# To get a better o/p we decided to keep only those entries, which are found in the apte's dict but not necessarily with the same lifga.
