=head1 change_dir_name_in_xsl.pl

change_dir_name_in_xsl.pl is needed to change the name of the directory in the xml file.
Since I do not know how to pass parameters to an xslt program, this script is written.

=head1 Usage

./change_dir_name_in_xsl.pl < input_file > output_file

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The name is generated as tmp_anu_dir which is later substituted by the correct path.
When xslt is replaced by a perl program, this program would not be required.
