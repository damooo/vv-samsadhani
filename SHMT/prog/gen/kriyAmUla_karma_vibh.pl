=head1 kriyAmUla_karma_viBakwi.pl


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Sanskrit nAmaXAwu are mapped to the kriyAmUla in Hindi. When this is done, the kriyAmUla itself assigns some vibhakti to its karma, which is different from the karma vibhakti in Sanskrit. This module takes care of this aspect.

=head1 EXAMPLES

This is invoked internally in the agreement module.
