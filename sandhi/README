About the package: 

This is a sandhi package, which does 'padaanta' sandhis.
It is basically a CGI script, meant for web service.
The program is written in perl.

The sandhi rules are classified into two categories: apavAda, and default.
First the machine searches for apavAda rules, and if not found, the default sandhi rules are applied.
ApavAda rules are expressed using regular expressions.
ApavAda rules which require special conditions on the categories, or semantic fields etc. (for example, conditions such as if the word is in dvi-vacana, or if the word is a pratyaya, etc.) are not yet handled.

The default rules have following 6 fields:

last_char_of_left_word,first-char_of_right_word,output,sandhi_name,sandhi_rule,udAharaNa
(All these fields are seperated by comma.)
